a. Query to find the total number of orders placed by each customer:

SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM
    customers c
LEFT JOIN
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY
    c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
ORDER BY
    total_orders DESC;

b. Query to list the products that have never been ordered:

SELECT
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name
FROM
    products p
LEFT JOIN
    order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
WHERE
    oi.order_item_id IS NULL;


c. Query to find the customer who has spent the most money in the last month:
Assume the current date is '2024-06-16'. We will find the customer who spent the most in the last month (from '2024-05-16' to '2024-06-16').

SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    SUM(oi.price * oi.quantity) AS total_spent
FROM
    customers c
JOIN
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN
    order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
WHERE
    o.order_date BETWEEN '2024-05-16' AND '2024-06-16'
GROUP BY
    c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
ORDER BY
    total_spent DESC
LIMIT 1;
